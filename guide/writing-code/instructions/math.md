# In Addition

Let's do a little bit of math. I swear it won't be bad!

First, we'll talk about the `add` instruction.

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
a = a + 1;
```
_In JavaScript, we're adding `1` to the contents of the variable `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `4`._

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
mov rax, 3;
add rax, 1;
```
_In assembly, we're adding `1` to the contents of the register `rax`. At the end of this, `rax` will contain the value `4`._

The `add` instruction adds the value on the right side (`1`) to the contents of the register on the left side (`rax`, which contains `3`). It then takes the sum of these two numbers and, like our `mov` instruction, stores the value _into_ the register on the left side (`rax`).

---

Just like our `mov` instruction, the `add` instruction can use the contents of a second register to operate on the first register.

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
let b = 1;

a = a + b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're adding the contents of `b` to the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `4`._

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, 1;

add rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In this example, what do you think the value of <code>rax</code> will be?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>We're adding the contents of <code>rbx</code> to the contents of <code>rax</code>. At the end of this, <code>rax</code> will contain the value <code>4</code>.</i>

</details>

## Subtraction

Subtraction works the same way as addition!

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 3;
let b = 1;

a = a - b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're subtracting the contents of `b` from the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `2`._

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
mov rax, 3;
mov rbx, 1;

sub rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In this example, what do you think the value of <code>rax</code> will be?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>We're subtracting the contents of <code>rbx</code> from the contents of <code>rax</code>. At the end of this, <code>rax</code> will contain the value <code>2</code>.</i>

</details>

<i>The <code>sub</code> instruction subtracts the contents of the register (<code>rbx</code>, which contains <code>1</code>) on the right side to the contents of the register on the left side (<code>rax</code>, which contains <code>3</code>). It then takes the difference of these two numbers and stores the value into the register on the left side (<code>rax</code>).</i>

## Multiplication

Not all assembly languages have multiplication or division, but x86-64 does! Yay for us!

```js
// JavaScript
let a = 2;
let b = 3;

a = a * b;
```
_In JavaScript, we're multiplying the contents of `b` with the contents of `a`. At the end of this, `a` will contain the value `6`._

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
mov rax, 2;
mov rbx, 3;

mul rax, rbx;
```
<details>
<summary><i>In assembly, we're multiplying the contents of <code>rbx</code> with the contents of <code>rax</code>. At the end of this, <code>rax</code> will contain the value <code>6</code>. Can you guess how the <code>mul</code> instruction works?</i></summary>

<br />
<i>The <code>mul</code> instruction multiplies the contents of the register (<code>rbx</code>, which contains <code>3</code>) on the right side to the contents of the register on the left side (<code>rax</code>, which contains <code>2</code>). It then takes the product of these two numbers and stores the value into the register on the left side (<code>rax</code>).</i>

## Putting it together

Now that we have some basic math under our belt, let's try to map a real equation to assembly! You may have learned the slope-intercept equation from school. If you're anything like me and don't recall, it looks like:

<p align="center">
  <br />
  <img height="200" src="https://cloud-jnidfb52p-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0graph.png">
  <br />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>
    $y = mx + b$
  </span>
</p>
<br />

We don't need to get into great detail about this equation, but this is the formula for finding the equation of a straight line. Here's how it works.

$m$ is the slope. If it's above 1, it means your line is going up faster. If it's between 0 and 1, it's going up slower. If it's negative, it's going downwards.

$b$ is the intercept. Every line will always eventually hit the $y$ axis, unless it's a line that's straight up and down. The $b$ intercept is where your line intersect the $y$ axis.

If you fill in $m$ & $b$ in the equation, you're left with $x$ & $y$ variables. Those $x$ and $y$ variables map directly to the the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point on the graph.

To get any point on the straight line, you plug in $x$ into the equation and you get the $y$ coordinate!

Let's assume we have a line represented by the slope-intercept equation $y = 2x + 4$. The assembly below will calculate the value of $y$ when you plug $3$ in for $x$. Here's how it would look:

<br />

```asm
; X86-64 Intel Syntax Assembly
mov rax, 2 ; rax will contain m
mov rbx, 3 ; rbx will contain x
mov rcx, 4 ; rcx will contain b

mul rax, rbx ; m * x, store in rax
add rax, rcx ; m * x + b, store in rax. rax now contains y!
```

<br />

Thanks for sticking with me to re-learn a little math. I think it's important to show that we can write real life functions like this using just assembly. Soon, we will learn about how to _loop_ over code, which will enable us to use this code to get all the points of a particular line, not just one.
